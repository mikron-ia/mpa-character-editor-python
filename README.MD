# Character Editor
This is a simple editor for character for some RPG systems. It is more a proof of concept than a working system intended for general use - and it is my attempt to learn python.

Thus the reader/user is advised that code may lack good practices.

## Notes
- This is an `urwid` project, thus is ill-suited for running under Windows; the only way to do it I know of is to use `cygwin` (and use specifically `cygwin`-provided python package)
- This is not intended to be a tool universally useful for all possible RPG systems, they are simply too diverse to accommodate; it was developed to work for systems I created and may - in the future - work with some of the systems available on the market
